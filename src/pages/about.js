    <p>Problem solver, no matter the problem/
I have extensive experience in understanding and translating what people express, so that it becomes a clear directed instruction we can then work on/
I strive to make things easier for the user, and believe that user testing and feedbacks are both a cure and a curse/
I have a degree in Psychology then pivoted towards design/
I am an aesthete/
I love video games and learning how to actually make them/
I am a nerd who will spend countless hours learning new skills (currently into design for VR) and will look up everything I don't know in the process/
I am a perfectionist/
I am a Lead Gift Evangelist, which means you will never have to pick a gift for someone ever again/
I draw cute things I sometimes put into my designs/​​​​​​​
I illustrate (stickers anyone?) and write for JAM London to make the product design conference a reality/</p>
